# Poloniex Portfolio Analysis Dashboard

The purpose of this tool is to provide an overview of one's Poloniex account.  It will show detailed analysis of current holdings, how portfolio value has changed over time, and provide a variety of advanced analysis of a user's trading history and account activity.

This project is currently not open source and will not be released to the public.  The reason for this is that there is no private information that needs to be released and I have hopes of making this site for-profit in the future.

## Progress
The current development tracker and planning area for the tool is located on the [Github Project Page](https://github.com/Ameobea/poloniex-dashboard/projects/1) for this repository.
